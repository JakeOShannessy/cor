\section*{Summary of Uncertainty Statistics for Empirical Correlations}

For each quantity of interest, the experimental relative standard deviation, $\widetilde{\sigma}\sb{E}$, model relative standard deviation, $\widetilde{\sigma}\sb{M}$, and model bias factor are shown in Table~\ref{summary_stats}, which are taken from each of the scatter plots in the corresponding chapters of this document. The latter two values indicate the average scatter and bias of the model predictions. For example, for a given quantity, a model relative standard deviation of 0.15 indicates that one standard deviation of all of the model predictions is equal to 15~\%, and a model bias factor of 1.05 indicates that, on average, the model tends to overpredict that quantity by 5~\%. The number of datasets and data points are also listed for each quantity.

For quantities with only a small number of experimental data points, additional experimental data is needed to justify the model uncertainty and bias. Note that some quantities exhibit a large amount of model uncertainty or are significantly under- or over-predicted, and some caution should be exercised when applying these empirical correlations. More detailed discussion on the application and usage of these statistical metrics is provided in the ``Quantifying Model Uncertainty'' chapter of the FDS Validation Guide~\cite{FDS_Validation_Guide}.
